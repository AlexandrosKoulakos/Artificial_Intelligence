# Artificial_Intelligence

This repository hosts the lab exercises in the course of Artificial Intelligence (7th semester, ECE - NTUA). In that context, we implement path search algorithms (A*, Best First, Hill Climbing), we develop a movie recommender based on metadata and we apply machine learning (Naive Bayes, Perceptron) for songs classification.
